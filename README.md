<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is my main repository that I use to showcase all the work I've done that can be shared, as well as any blog posts (that I plan on creating).
If you're reading this, then you're actually looking at the back side of my GitHub site! :sweat_smile: How about peaking around the <a href="https://clairefox.github.io/">front</a> first if you haven't already?

Currently I am an Automation Engineer. I write scripts in PowerShell (mainly), Python, C#, and use other tools (like UiPath RPA and Microsoft Power Automate) to automate processes. The main goal of automation is to save time with mundane or Business As Usual (BAU) tasks so that other team members are freed up to do more value-adding activities! I firmly believe that automation is not a means to downsize, but a tool to help improve team member productivity, knowledge, and relieve stress! I know I feel better when the boring stuff is off my plate! :relieved:

My main goal of having this portfolio site is to be creative first, and showcase my work second. I'll be including links to this on my resume, but I tend to stick with a company for a long time when hired, so I don't know how much traffic this will actually receive. So I'm just going to have fun with it!

### Built With

* [GitHub Pages](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/github-pages)
* [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#reference-style-links)


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

You like it? You really like it!
If you like my site and want to make your own copy, I guess that's okay. :sweat_smile:
Please make sure to not outright copy my work, make it your own instead and do enjoy the process of creating it!

### Prerequisites

If you haven't made a GitHub Pages before, please check out their tutorial here.
* https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/github-pages

### Installation

1. Clone the repo.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Clairefox/clairefox.github.io.git
   ```
2. Change directories to your new local copy.
   ```sh
   cd <location repo was saved locally>
   ```
3. Update the remote url to point to your repository.
   ```sh
   git remote set-url origin <your repo url>
   ```
4. Create your changes and commit/push!

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/othneildrew/Best-README-Template/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).

Other than those posted there, some of the things I would like to explore and include on here are:
* Data Science with Python. Statistics, probability, and what not!
* More Python in general actually. I mainly write code in PowerShell recently.

<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->
## Contributing

Since this is my personal portfolio, I'm going to have to say contributing is limited to just myself for this particular project. 
However, if you find an issue or want to suggest something to me, please feel free to contact me or submit an issue/feature request!
